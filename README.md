# WeatherNow

**WeatherNow** is an app that utilizes the MVC pattern
and the UIKit framework. It relies on OpenWeatherMap's API to offer real-time weather information, it gets the current location through Corelocation and dynamically updates an image to reflect the current weather conditions.

The app also supports Dark mode!
